A Smallest K integers Algorithm and My Solution 



Algo: Given an array of positive integers nums, return the smallest k values

Example:

Input: nums = [5, 9, 3, 6, 2, 1, 3, 2, 7, 5], k = 4
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3]
Explanation:Smallest number is 1, 2nd smallest is 2, 
            3rd smallest is 2, 4th smallest is 3
Note:

The result can be in any order, [2, 1, 3, 2] is also a correct answer


 Step # 1 / 2
Sort the array for nums
 Step # 2 / 2
Return first k items from the nums function
